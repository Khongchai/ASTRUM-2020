              But I’m not the tiniest. Pluto is the tiniest amongst us Milky Way siblings. 
              But I heard Pluto was <span   onmousedown="displaysonOver('mercury-info-kickedout')" ><strong>kicked out</strong></span> 
              of the family because he was too small and too far away. 
              Well, I think Pluto is <i>ohana</i> and <i>ohana</i> means family and family mean no one gets
               left behind or forgotten. But Planet 3627-7 inhabitants say otherwise. 
               Well, I have never crossed paths with Pluto, so I guess they must be right. It's still a pity though.
              <br>
              <br>
              I’m hot. But I’m not the hottest. 
              My next door <span   onmousedown="displaysonOver('mercury-info-neighbors')"><strong>neighbors</strong></span> are hotter than me.  
              Venus, my sister, likes to keep the heat to herself. 
              Sun, my roommate, is literally a star. Sun and I usually go for walks in circles, 
              although I mostly do the walking and spinning while Sun just <span   onmousedown="displaysonOver('mercury-info-stays')" ><strong>stays on her seat</strong></span>. 
              Everyone else walks at a slower pace, but I guess it’s because they’re not as close to Sun as I am. 
              Well, our friendship is kind of inclusive, so only a select few are within our orbit.
              <br>
              <br>
              Why is it that my other brothers and sisters get to have visitors that come through the door while only 
              I have <span   onmousedown="displaysonOver('mercury-info-visitors')" ><strong>visitors</strong></span> that stay at a distance and just take pictures? 
              I thought MESSENGER would at least stay for tea, but he only took a few photos and then died on my doorstep, 
              leaving a 16 meter crack on my pretty surface. The audacity!
              <br><br>
              And sun, my roommate! Goodness, sometimes when she's mad, 
              she throws a tantrum and hits me with her waves <strong   onmousedown="displaysonOver('mercury-info-solarwinds')">solar winds</strong>, 
              stripping away my atmosphere and stealing my breath away.
              <br>
              <br>
              Sometimes I cry about my appearance. I’m gray and wrinkly and <span   onmousedown="displaysonOver('mercury-info-dead')" ><strong>dead</strong></span>. 
              There’s nothing interesting about me and I have no moons to speak of. 
              I might as well be a moon myself, as Planet 3627-7’s moon looks a lot like me.
               Venus says my wrinkles look like interweaving constellations. 
               I think she’s just trying to be nice, but it’s the thought that counts.

              Mercury is currently the smallest planet in the solar system.
              Its close proximity to the sun makes it more sensitive to any solar activity, so much so that we can study the effects of our aging sun through the planet. 
              It orbits around the sun blazingly fast, at the speed of around 87.97 Earth days, but on the contrary, it rotates so slow, only 3 times every 2 mercury years, 
              that astronomers once thought that it was tidally locked with the sun. But a slow rotation is nonetheless a slow rotation, and it has resulted in the planet having 
              wildly different temperatures at all times. 
              <br><br>
              The side facing the sun can get as hot as 427 degrees celsius, whereas the night side can get as low as -180 degrees. 
              The reason for this being the strong solar radiation constantly strips away Mercury's atmosphere. Without a sufficiently thick atmosphere, 
              the planet is unable to dissipate heat to the other side 
              of the planet and thus resulted in the majority of it being dissipated instead into space.

              In my attempt to create a pseudo version of Mercury,  
              I have taken direct inspiration from scientific phenomena. 
              My goal here is to have my music function similar to a photo, as opposed to the story-book type of composition that 
              I have used for my other pieces in this project. Instead of colored pixels, I have used sounds to paint out the still-frame of Mercury; 
              combining low synth hum with sampled sounds of the violins we get something that is both bright and dark at the same time, which I have used to 
              represent the sun; and some high pitched, and distorted sounds for the stripping away of Mercury's atmosphere, for example. These are only two of
               many sonic representations I have done for this piece, to learn more about what happens, and has happened on Mercury, you can tap on the bold text 
               on the left for more details.

              Mercury is not only small but is shrinking as well as the planet cools down. It is now 14 kilometers smaller in diameter than it was 4 billion years ago.
              Mercury is not the only planet losing its heat over billions of years, in fact, every celestial object is, from the sun to the farthest planet in our solar system,
               but Mercury seems to be the one affected the most, due to its core accounting for over 60% of its mass. In comparison, Earth's core is only 15% of its volume.
                <br>
               <br>
               This shrinking of Mercury over millions of years has given rise to ridges and escarpments alongside its marks from asteroid impacts.
               To the left is a alse color image taken by MESSENGER spacecraft. It reveals ridges, escarpments, and craters through 
               colors, with blue being low and yellow/green showing higher elevations.

              The reclassification was due to Pluto failing to meet the third criterion of the International Astronomical Union. The third criterion
              states that it must have cleared its neighboring region of other objects -- to put simply, there must not be any other objects
              sharing its orbit. It is now holding the status of a dwarf planet, along with several others such as Makemake, Ceres, Eris, Haumea, etc.
              Most of which resides beyond the orbit of Neptune, with some being in the Kuiper Belt.

              Had Mercury been allowed a thicker atmosphere, the planet's temperature would soar past that of venus and snatch the title of the hottest

              According to Newton's third law, every planet orbits its stars, or every satellite its planet, exert an equivalent amount of
              pull in its own direction; the smaller the mass, the smaller the pull. This tug of war causes both objects to orbit around a center of mass. 
              Between a small object such as Mercury and the sun, the effect is more difficult to detect, but it is there. In fact, this minuscule wobble in a star causes a doppler effect, and it is one of the methods scientists use
              to detect exoplanets thousands of light 
              -years away. <br><br>

              Doppler effect is a phenomenon whereby the frequency of a wave is changed in relation to an observer; namely, during the dance between 
              a star and its planet, as the star wobble closer to us (observer), the light wave gets squished, and as it moves farther, the wave gets 
              more spaced out. We can detect this wobble through the shift in the spectrum of light and a plethora of exoplanets have been discovered through
              this method. 
              <br><br>
              Doppler effect is how RADAR detects the speed of an object combining the shift in the received signal and the interval between the send and receive.
              This effect is also responsible for the shift in the sound of siren's and race cars as they move closer and away from an observer.

             The size of Mercury's iron core hinted at first glance, that it should possess an Earth-like level of magnetic field. However, 
             the strength of its magnetosphere is only 1.1% that of the Earth's. Also, instead of having a stable atmosphere like we do. 
             <br>
             <br>
             Mercury has 
             a relatively thin exosphere that is constantly being taken away by strong solar winds. Luckily, it is constantly replaced by dust kicked up from extreme activities, 
             such as meteor strikes or from particles//dust that are sent off into space by the solar winds themselves, as part of them innevitably hit the 
             surface of the planet. Mercury's magnetosphere, though significantly weaker than ours, is strong enough to deflect most of the solar winds, 
             allowing it to replenish and retain, though unstable, its exosphere.

              So far, only two spacecraft have visited Mercury, the Mariner 10 in the seventies, and a much more recent visit from MESSENGER in 2008. 
              The current detailed photographic mapping and data that we have of Mercury was taken and collected by MESSENGER during its three flybys. 
              <br><br>
              The spacecraft became the first to have entered Mercury's orbit in 2011.
               Similar to Cassini's death, MESSENGER used its last propellant to deorbit itself and crash into the planet. 
               The last farewell photo from the spacecraft was a photo of a flat plain, a then crater after MESSENGER's crash.

              On the outside, Mercury might look just like our moon, dead and lifeless. But MESSENGER's mission has revealed the contrary. 
              Mercury is NOTHING like the moon, it might be much less active than it was when it was younger. We know that it has, weak though it is, a 
              magnetic field. And false color image has revealed that its mineralogy of the planet is also vastly different from our satellite. We can 
              leverage these findings to help us answer questions about how rocky planets such as Earth and Mercury evolve overtime.

              Our conclusion was that a short piece of a novel with accurate details regarding the planet, with the music as its musical score. 
              Science fiction has always been a huge part of our culture and it'd be a shame for me to not pay homage to that at least once in this interdisciplinary project.

              We have photographs of the actual surface of the planet and we know that her surface is red-brown in color. 
              The main contributor to the color of any planet's hue is, however, its atmospheric content. Venus's atmosphere comprises
               mainly of sulfuric acid and its clouds reflect and scatter sunlight, giving it its whittish-orange coloration.

               Looking at the color of a planet from a photo can also be misleading, as some photos are taken through different filters to obtain

              Venus is the brightest planet in the night sky and can be easily spotted with the naked eye. 
              It is called morning star sometimes due to its position in the sky being quite close to the sun, 
              both at dusk and dawn. <br><br>
              Planets in our solar system appear brighter than stars millions of kilometers 
              away thanks to them being much closer to our world, giving the reflected sunlight, a direct path to Earth. How bright
              the reflected light is depends on how much it is absorbed. The sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere is very reflective, granting it 
              the title of the brightest planet in the night sky.

              Due to Venus' thick cloud and crushing atmosphere, our only practical method for surface mapping 
              was through radar. Through the mapped data we see that most of the surface is covered by volcanic 
              features indicating the major roles of volcanism in shaping Venus' surface. Despite most of its 1600
               major volcanos being extinct, the temperature on the surface of Venus is still a lead-melting 467 C, 
               thanks to its runaway greenhouse effect. 
               <br>
               <br>
              However, whether Venus is still a volcanically active planet or not remains a hot debate 
              in the field of astronomy as most of the data are from long-range measurements. 
              Sending probes are out of the question and they would not last even an hour under the pressure and the heat.

              Other than spinning backwards, this planet also spins very very slowly. 
              Scientists do not know with absolute certainty why but the possibilities are 
              that Venus might have been hit once in the past by an object so last its entire 
              orbit slowed down to a crawl and began to spin backwards. <br><br>
              
              Another 
              less dramatic theory is that it is from the state of tidal locking with the sun. 
              Similar to the perfect and almost 1:1 spin-orbit ratio of Earth-Moon and Sun-Mercury, 
              by being almost tidally locked with the orbited object, the spin rate of the orbiter will slow down dramatically.

              Venus is a great study case for the impact of the greenhouse effect on our world. 
              We can see how severe the effect of heat-trapping of the CO2 can be. Even though Venus 
              is not the closest planet to the sun, its ability to retain heat more than makes up for 
              its distance. The heat of more than 400 C on Venus is hot enough to melt Lead. 
              Any spacecraft not properly insulated or with its insulation compromised will most 
              likely have their electronics fried within seconds of entering its atmosphere.

              In order for any orbiting object to remain in orbit of the orbited, its relative perpendicular 
              velocity must be enough such that it falls in a "circular manner". To put in mathematically, 
              the gravity acts as a pull in the y-direction(sin), and the object's perpendicular velocity is 
              x-direction(cos). When this happens, the object will travel in the tangent direction to the path of the body. 
              <br>
              <br>

              This is why we often see spacecraft that loses its speed in sci-fi films around a planet often gets pulled by the planet's gravity; 
              when the change in x-direction stops, the only thing left will be just a y pull, aka "falling".

              Earth: There is a saying shared across the universe.

              Planet 3627-7 is a special world. It is a liquid world that fills up <span   onmousedown="displaysonOver('earth-info-water')"><strong>three-fourths</strong></span> of its mass with water, yet sustains billions of species of creatures. Its

              and into the <span><strong   onmousedown="displaysonOver('earth-info-deep')" >depths</strong></span> of its oceans. 
              It is a world filled with an array of color unlike any other planet in its solar system. 
              The <span   onmousedown="displaysonOver('earth-info-magneticfield')" ><strong>firmament</strong></span> protects it from the radiation of the sun. 
              Frozen water fall from the sky like fine white dust for a quarter of a cycle. 
              It is filled with these things called trees that release <span   onmousedown="displaysonOver('earth-info-atmosphere')" ><strong>gases</strong></span> that sustain life in its atmosphere, and that it is a world filled with creatures as 
              tall as the trees and as small as the pebbles on the ground. 
              <br>
              <br>
              It is said that the world’s rulers, creatures called humans, are the oddest of all. 
              They live with plants and beasts that can kill them, but they have dominion above them all. 
              They breathe in gases that burn them slowly inside at the rate of about 80 cycles around the sun. 
              They have created settlements where temperatures dip to as low as -90 degrees and as high as 50 degrees and still reproduce. 
              They capture the wind in the sails of their contraptions and journey across the waters. 
              They then take the wind as their own and fly above the sky, defying their planet’s own gravity. 
              The sun’s solar winds hit its atmosphere but instead of fearing it, they stare in awe at the lights they have named 
              <span   onmousedown="displaysonOver('earth-info-aurora')" ><strong>Aurora Borealis.</strong></span> 
              As daylight in the night, these northern lights weaved amongst the silver clouds in a hypnotic dance, distorting in an array of 
              green and purple with tongues of reds and oranges flickering in between. 
              <br>
              <br>
              But they were not satisfied with the sky. These humans decided to venture out of their world and into outer space, 
              touching upon their moon and sending their metal creature <span   onmousedown="displaysonOver('earth-info-depthofuniverse')" ><strong>into the depths of the universe</strong></span>, seeking others 
              like them – hoping to find a connection – hopelessly lost. But the universe kept silent.
              <br>
              <br>
              But the universe speaks of them. They speak of the terrible and marvelous things of the complex planet. The planet these humans call Earth.

              Earth, our home. Our only home. Our entire history is written on the surface of this minuscule blue globe. She has been taking care of us for millions
              of years. Writing music for something that encapsulates so many things people can relate to is possibly one of the most challenging aspects of this 
              project. The way I approached this is to capture the essence of sounds we are familiar with through use of synthesizers and acoustic sounds sampling.
              For example, the sound of white noise could represent a number of things, waterfall, wind, the rustling of leaves, ocean waves, etc. Of course, pure white noise
              would not sound so good without proper manipulation, so, that will be part of the process as well.

              The use of synthesizers in this piece is to bring the sense of being similar, yet not entirely so; an aural uncanny valley. Had I used
              entirely acoustic sounds, the elements of this piece would sound too familiar, people would recognize immediately where to place the 
              sounds in their perceived reality. What I intend for this piece is to bring the listener out of their reality and to look at Earth the same
              way we look at other planets; the marvel she holds and her fragility. The writer of the story for Earth has perfectly captured the essence of 
              my intention in her beautifully written work on the left.

	            During the formation of the solar system, we can see from the composition of the inner planets that water and other gaseous elements could not have possibly formed within this region, as it was far too hot
              for liquid water to form. The accepted theory now is that water was delivered to Earth from icy planetesimals from the farther region of the protoplanetary disk.

              During the protoplanetary disk stage, the four rocky inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, each acquired their own atmosphere by pulling in gas from the 
              disk when they grew large enough to resist the gas drag posed by the surrounding gas. To retain the gathered gas, each planet must be sufficiently large, such that
              the escape velocity is greater than the speed of the gas's atom. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Earth's atmosphere came from absorbing those gases during the early stage and the ones spewing out of volcanoes. Early Earth's atmosphere was similar to Venus, 
              as both planets formed in relatively close proximity of each other. The breathable air that we have today is thanks to the early life forms on earth that brought in 
              the photosynthetic system.

              Launched in 1977, Voyager 1 currently holds the place for the farthest human-made object from Earth. Traveling at the speed of 17km/s the spacecraft would take about 300 more years to
              reach the edge of our solar system: Oort cloud and will be in 1.7 light-years of its destination in the constellation Ophiuchus, the star AC+79 3888, in the year 40,272 AD.

              <br>
              Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft both had small metal plates loaded onto them that carried the information of their place of origin. For Voyager 1, 
              however, the data was a tad more ambitious. The message is carried by a gold-plated copper disk phonograph record. It contains  music from various periods
              , sounds from many cultures, and images showing the diversity of life on Earth.

              Mars and Venus are situated not too far away from the goldilocks zone, which makes them perfect candidates to consider building our next home. However, Venus is a hot and tumultuous place, with temperature hotter than our baking ovens, rendering it inhospitable for any known-lifeform, leaving us our final candidate: Mars.

              Mars is by itself, just a dead planet where nothing happens at all, but this planet holds many treasures within. Geological data reveals that Mars was once, like Earth. We have so far, mapped over 40,000 river valleys from Mars with some even wider than our widest river. It also has huge polar icecaps which could serve as our water reservoir in the future.

              Mars' deadliest disaster is luckily for us, its 60 miles an hour wind speed. With an atmosphere as thin as Mars, such wind speed would be equivalent to the light comfy winter breeze we get here on Earth. With natural disasters out of the way, we should be able to focus on important aspects of building a self-sustained colony.

              humans slowly evacuate from the dying planet Earth. As they approach the looming red planet, several thoughts pop up in their heads, from
              the scarcity of resources to the vast and empty inhabitable landscape on which to become their new home, most likely until their last breath.

              the scratchy dust-wind, to the haunting cry of the far-away storm hovering in the lower atmosphere. It is a sonic juxtaposition of humans against 
              nature on this dead planet.

              aspects as well. To build a self-sustainable colony on Mars, we have to ensure that it is able to cater for itself (it would take
              too long for Earth's resources to reach Mars) when it comes to resources, be it for humans or machines.

            <p class="planetsubdesctext subtexthide" id="mars-info-red">
              The reddish hue on Mars is a result of rusty dust suspended in the atmosphere; however, a closer inspection of the planet would reveal that the surface is more orange-red rather than the strong reddish hue depicted in many
              oversaturated photos on the internet.

              <br>
              The rust in the atmosphere comes from the oxidized iron on the surface. The iron oxide, which is the same compound that gives blood its red color, when 
              interacting with oxygen, appears red as it absorbs blue and green spectrum of light.
              We don't know, however, whether the rust on Mars occurred due to rainstorms in the past, when Mars was still a young and rather wet planet, 
              or is it a gradual process of the rocks' interaction to the Martian atmosphere over billions of years.

            <p class="planetsubdesctext subtexthide" id="mars-info-barren">
              One of the most concerning aspects of living on Mars lies in its nothingness. On Earth, most of our agricultural activities are done outdoors; grow crops, livestock, etc. But on Mars, its surface is a true rocky desert of nothingness, we will have to engineer our ways through the myriads of problems facing a true self-sustained colony; namely, how can we make sure that the colony will have a constant supply of Energy, how do we keep the few first generations of people sane, how do we grow food, how do we get water, etc. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Without air and most likely, a limited supply of oxygen at first, taking a walk outside would be out of the question. The temperature outside is a freezing minus 60 degrees with only 0.1% oxygen in the atmosphere. Mars dust is also recognized to be harmful to our respiratory systems. The biggest challenge of Mars therefore lies not only in how to get there but how to “stay” there.

              We have learned about Mars’ storm the hard way when the probe Mariner arrived at Mars in 1971 expecting to see new fine details of this planet’s surface. What we got instead was a storm that covers virtually the entire planet that lasted for a month. 

              <br>
              <br>
              The dust storm on Mars contains dust particles that are much finer than on Earth. 
              All equipment must be specially engineered to be functional for a sustained period in such a condition, such as NASA’s rovers. 
              Mars has a relatively thin atmosphere of 1% of Earth’s atmosphere, so storms of Mars would be comparable to a light breeze on Earth. 
              However, Mars is still a very “dusty” place, and this could pose several problems in the long run such as blocking the sunlight from the solar panels, 
              thus decreasing the power output significantly.

              The gravity on Mars is about 3.711 meters per second squared, in other words, an object falling at Mars would see an increase in its speed by 3.711 m/s every second. 
              In comparison, Earth is about 9.807 m/s^2. A person weighing 100kg on Earth would only weigh around 38kg on Mars.

              With gravity even fewer than half of Earth’s, astronauts on Mars would have to work hard to prevent muscle atrophy. 
              Though it will definitely not be as bad as their spaceflight to the planet will have been, 
              living in such a condition for a long period of time could bring about several medical conditions.

              Olympus Mons is the tallest mountain found anywhere in the solar system, towering over even our Mount Everest and Mauna Kea. 
              Its diameter is around the size of an entire country: 624 km, and a height of 24 km. 
              In comparison, the cruising altitude of a commercial airplane is around 7 km.

                  “I will do my best to not fool around.”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">“You better.” She patted his visor and gave his spacesuit a once over. “Looks like you’re ready to go.”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">The EVA (Extravehicular Activity) Team stood ready inside the mid-deck.

                <span class="storyIndent">The hiss of the doors opened as the cabin depressurized. One by one, 
                  the astronauts climbed out of the spacewalk hatches and out in the freezing landscape of Europa. </span>

                <span class="storyIndent">“One step for man,” Houston stepped on its icy surface. “One giant leap for mankind.”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent"> As <strong onmousedown="displaysonOver('jupiter-info-quoted')">quoted</strong> by <i>the</i> Neil Armstrong. </span><br>
                
                <span class="storyIndent">Cheers broke out in the crew compartment and the space station on Earth as 
                  they celebrated the historic moment. Houston started walking out with the rest of the astronauts following him. 
                  The team fanned out, inspecting the surface of the moon and bagging samples to be taken back to the spacecraft for examination.</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">Houston reported the data scanned by his helmet. “All is of a temperature of -170◦C. 
                  No sign of life as of yet.”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">It was still.</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">Until it wasn't.</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">Houston looked up. "You guys feelthat?"</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">Reider said in annoyance, “Houston, I swear if this is one of your jokes again-”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">“No, no. I’m serious. There was a vibration.”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">“Probably just the ice shifting from the <strong onmousedown="displaysonOver('jupiter-info-underwatervents')">underwater vents</strong>.” 
                  One of his team, Meri Lee, spoke up.</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">“Could be aquatic sea life.” Vaniya Stokvesky quipped.</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent"> “Could be Cthulhu.”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent"> “Could be.”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent"> “Focus!” Reider snapped.</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">They all went back to their posts, inspecting the cracked ice.
                  Reddish-brown spotted the surface. Houston crouched down and grabbed a handful, frowning. His screen displayed the elements of the ice and he didn’t like what it said.</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent"> “What’s wrong?” One of the astronauts, Carlos Rodney, asked.</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">Houston said, “I was just thinking…they said this <strong onmousedown="displaysonOver('jupiter-info-redbrown')">reddish-brown</strong> stuff is sea salt gunk. But I wonder if there’s a way I could smell this thing.”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent"> Rodney’s eyes widened. “You think it’s…blood?”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">“I don’t know.” He said as he bagged it. “I mean, one of the components of this moon includes iron-sulfur. But then again, I could be wrong.”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">As he crouched up, he surveyed the landscape. The <strong onmousedown="displaysonOver('jupiter-info-surface')">surface</strong> was jagged, with outcrops and cliffs of ice.</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent"> “Where’s Clifford?”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent"> They all froze. It was a headcount of 4. There were supposed to be 5.</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">“Houston, stop joking around.” Reider said nervously. “All of this conversation is being recorded.”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent"> “You think I’d joke at a time like this?” Houston snapped. “Clifford, can you hear me, over?”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">There was a crackle, but no sound. The four people on the moon grouped together.</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">“Clifford, come in, over.”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">No sound.</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent"> “You don’t think he slipped in the ice and knocked his head?” </span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent"> Houston switched the screens. The Navigation System showed four dots grouped together and a dot a few meters away. 
                  “He’s 50 meters West and moving away fast.”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent"> They exchanged looks of confusion.</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">“Something is wrong.”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">The four swiftly ran to where Clifford was headed. Just then, a hole silently opened up and one of them fell through.</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">“Meri!”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">She clung to the surface, screaming for help, but lost her hold and slipped beneath. There was a slight crackle over the comms and then…silence.</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent"> “Watch your step.” Houston commanded. </span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">“No sudden movements.”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent"> “Houston, we’ve got a problem.” Reider said in horror. “We’ve lost connection with Meri Lee and Clifford.”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">The remaining three members looked around nervously, bracing themselves against an elusive enemy.</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">“Your orders, captain?” Houston asked quietly.</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent"> “Abort mission.”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent"> With caution, they quickly headed back to the ship, 
                  careful not to make any sudden movements. A shift of the ice on their left, and then a hole opened up, swallowing Rodney.</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">“RUN!”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent"> Houston and Vaniya sprinted to the aircraft, 
                  terrified at the very ground they tread on. The ice shifted and a hole gaped wide open. Houston leaped over it just in time, but Vaniya fell through.</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent"> “Vaniya!”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">Houston grabbed her arm as she scrambled to get out of the hole – only to 
                  scream as the water and the ice turned red, warm blood <strong onmousedown="displaysonOver('jupiter-info-steaming')">steaming</strong> as it met the freezing ocean.
                  He tried pulling her up, but his strength was lost as she slipped through his fingers.</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">“Houston! Get back to the ship!”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent"> Houston scrambled up and ran for his life. As the ice shifted in front of him, he leaped and grabbed on one of the railings just as a hole opened up.
                  The payload bay opened and he slipped inside, clicking it shut just as something large and wet slammed on it.</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent">“What was that?” Houston shouted.</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent"> “I don’t want to know.” Reider said grimly. “Ready for takeoff.”</span><br>

                <span class="storyIndent"> “Thrusters are a go.”</span><br>

              Rather than focusing on Jupiter, I personally prefer messing around, trying to create a story that 
              revolves around its moon Europa. In our solar system, there are two moons that could potentially 
              harbor life as we know it, Enceladus of Saturn, and Europa of Jupiter. I was quite confident that 
              I wanted to pursue the alien-life form discovery route for one of them, but I was not sure which. 
              Luckily, the journey of Cassini through the solar system has given me something to latch on as the main focus for Saturn's story, 
              removing Enceladus from our option.
              <br><br>
              In my research, I have alluded briefly 
              to the inaccuracies of the previous musical works of this genre, for example, 
              Venus from Holst sounding calm// serene, and Mars sounding angry//thrilling. 
              The music invoke the wrong mental image for each planet. Here, not going the route in keeping with 
              most of the other 5 planets I did -- taking direct inspiration from direct scientific findings -- 
              the stories for Jupiter (and Venus), attempts at sci-fi novelization with music their musical scores,
               while still staying true to all the facts.

               Jupiter is many things, from being an absolute eye candy of a planet to being our guard dog, 
              keeping rogue asteroids away from our beautiful blue planet with its massive gravitational pull.
               However, the planet's surface, or the lack thereof, is not really somewhere we humans look forward to be in,
                and definitely not somewhere life as we know it can exist. Its fast-moving winds, its freezing cold -- literally -- temperature, 
                and its insane gravity are more than enough to ensure that a trip to Jupiter will be most likely a one-way trip. 
                However, there is one place that has been attracting more and more attention from scientists over the years, 
                as it could potentially harbor life. That place is Europa.
              <br><br>
              Europa's putative warm ocean underneath is said to be very habitable for life
               as we know it. Data on both Europa and Enceladus, a very similar moon to Europa, 
               indicates that water plumes that get ejected from both moons indeed contain all the 
               materials needed for life to form. Water plumes and Europa's relatively hole-less surface 
               are both an indication of geological activity; a sign that the planet is still alive. 
               One of the theories on the forming of life on Earth deals with the formation of the first
                single-celled organisms around underwater thermal vents on Earth, which Europa also has hidden under 
                her icy surface.

              The average temperature on the surface of Europa is around minus 160 degrees celsius, and minus 220 celsius around the poles. 
              We have many ways of determining the temperatures of distant objects, the easiest one to understand is the infrared camera. 
              This picture to the right was taken by the Galileo spacecraft from a distance of 65,000 kilometers from Europa, 
              using the onboard infrared camera to get the temperature through measuring the strength of the infrared radiation.

            Contrary to how oxygen tanks are attached to the back of a diver underwater, in space, the harsh environment means 
            that we have to not only give astronauts oxygen but rather, to synthesize the entire habitable environment inside their suits. 
            The system responsible for regulating the suits' pressure and air circulation is called the PLSS -- Primary Life Support System. 
            The supply usually allows for around 7 hours of EVA.
            <br><br>
            Though the genetically engineered plant as mentioned in the story maybe a little too far-fetched, 
            we have something being developed that might prove to be even better than this imaginary plant species 
            such as the pressure swing absorption system, which aids in the separation of CO2 from breathing air by 
            venting the gas out into space.

              Juno in Greek Mythology is the wife of Jupiter. When Jupiter summoned a veil of clouds 
              around himself to hide his mischief, Juno peered through the clouds and revealed Jupiter's nature. 
              One cannot find a more befitting name for this spacecraft, as its mission is to indeed, "peer" below
               the dense cloud of the giant planet and uncover the secrets and the origins of our solar system. 
               Juno will observe Jupiter's gravity and magnetic fields, atmospheric dynamics and composition, and
                evolution. Juno is still in operation and its current position can be viewed from the NASA's Eyes web application above.

              One of the most misquoted famous space quotes. Neil Armstrong himself even confirmed that he did not say "One small step for man" but
              rather, "One small step for a man", as in <i>himself</i> as the man. The "a" in the Apollo is missing due to bad audio recording. However, 
              a computer programmer from London, Peter Shann Ford has found out in his analysis in 2006, what he thought was definitely the footprint for the missing "a" in the 
              original recording.

              During Cassini's flyby of Europa, it did not witness any water vapor shooting out of
               the planet like it did on Enceladus. However, the tidal flexing -- which is several 
               orders of magnitude stronger than any radiological source like we have here on Earth -- 
               on Europa remains a strong contestant for the main heat source for Europa's hydrothermal activity. 
               In the worst-case scenario, even if Europa lacks hydrothermal activities, oxygen and hydrogen of Earth's 
               level could still form under the surface through serpentinization. Water can also act as a strong barrier 
               against strong radiation radiating from Jupiter.

              The reddish lines crisscrossing Europa's surface are ridges marking weak lines,
               the weakest parts in the moon's icy surface. These lines are exacerbated by the 
               gravitational flexing exerted by Jupiter on the moon. The reddish color can possibly
                be attributed to the contaminating minerals from the ocean underneath.

              Saturn has a harem of icy moons under her wing, with Enceladus being the most scientifically intriguing. 
              She is an icy moon with a liquid water ocean underneath its surface. Its thermal vents periodically spew water 
              ice out into space, which can then be collected by spacecraft. And from these sampled ingredients, we have found Enceladus 
              to be very promising for alien life to thrive, as it has all the necessary chemical ingredients.<br><br>
              
              
              Before we found out about its underwater geysers, researchers were dumbfounded as to how Enceladus got 
              its stripes all over the surface. The thermal activity under Enceladus can be attributed to the gravitational tidal 
              forces imposed upon the moon as it rotates around Saturn, stretching and squeezing it, resulting in heat. With heat comes pressure, 
              and with such an enormous pressure building up underneath, cracks get formed, and eventually, the thinnest part of the 
              ice plates crack open, releasing giant sprays of water ice into space.

              Titan is said to be able to "hypothetically" harbor some sort of non-water-based life. 
              Why? Titan is the only place besides Earth known to have systems of liquid lakes, seas 
              and rivers present on its surface. The difference is that those liquids are not water, 
              but rather methane and ethane. Titan is also large enough to be classified as a plant, 
              had it not been orbiting Saturn; it is even larger than Mercury.

              Orbital resonance is a phenomenon that occurs whenever there are 2 or more celestial bodies orbiting a common object. 
              The ratios for a perfect orbital resonance are near-integer, whereas unstable resonances produce decimals. 
              Some near-integer ratios can be seen in this

              </span>

              Resonances will also affect the eccentricities of the involved objects, 
              such that the geometric relationship of their orbits are altered. 
              See the right image for a graphical representation of a Laplace Resonance; 
              an orbital resonance involving three bodies that have a ratio of 1:2:4.
              <br><br>
              A stable resonance is what keeps any orbiting body stable, namely, any external 
              gravitational influence will not be able to disrupt a system where an orbital resonance occurs.  
              In the case of Saturn, orbital resonances give rise to a stable trail of particles around the ring,
               whereas unstable gaps, such as the two occupied by two of Jupiter's moons.

              Cassini's death was arguably the most dramatic and well-known spacecraft suicide, if you can call it that, of all time. Possibly 
              because the last mission happened between 2016 and 2017; during the renaissance of the social network. Her last "Grand Finale" was a series of
              daring maneuvers, with the final goal of plunging into Saturn's atmosphere, ending it's long 20 years adventure.

              Cassini's last series maneuvers expanded over six-month in length. It was daring and dangerous, but it was at the end of her mission
              and scientists understood the risk. And it was indeed worth every risk. The spacecraft had to dive through the gap between Saturn's rings
              every week, giving us invaluable data and images such as the one to the right.

              The picture shows Daphnis, one of Saturn's smaller satellites, orbiting Saturn in between two of her rings. These six months, however, should
              not be the only thing Cassini is known for, as her 20-year-journey has given us much more than that. To the left is a .gif showing Cassini's mapping
              of Saturn's biggest moon, Titan. Cassini dropped the piggybacking <i>Huygens</i> Lander onto the moon. Together, they both have given us 
              enough data to confirm that Titan, alongside Enceladus, could be harbouring life of some form, if not on the surface, then under. <br><br>
              
              The data was actually why they needed to crash
              Cassini into Saturn, as we need to keep the moons clean for future exploration and to prevent any stowaway microbial life from spreading
              colonies on them.
              <br><br>
              During her final plunge, she managed to collect some outstanding data  regarding those, but not limited to, Saturn's rotation speed and its magnetic field. The highlight of
              the show, however, was its last picture, a picture that would most certainly leave an indelible footprint in the history of space travels. 
              The picture itself reveals nothing of stellar nature, but it is rich with stories. It speaks of the incredible things humans can do; it is the 
              culmination of sweat and tears of 28 nations; it is an escarpment of goodness amongst the tundra of chaos and conflicts in the world. It reminds the pointlessness
              of wars and battles. Without an eye on the horizon, it asks us is it even living -- fighting for something so perennial?

              Mysteries shroud this cerulean planet. Uranus, alongside Neptune, are two planets that are relatively lacking
              in details. The other 2 giants, Jupiter and Saturn has had spacecraft sent specifically to study them in details;
              Juno for Jupiter, and Cassini-Huygens for Saturn. This has made the process of composing a piece for Uranus and Neptune 
              more challenging as our information is rather limited and both planets, as far as we know, share quite a number of similarities,
              even the color. I therefore have decided to focus on different aspects of their features. I can either on their elusiveness and
              the artistic portrayal, or something that describes them in a more intimate way, such as the planets' features, and how
              to translate them into sonic paradigms.
              <br><br>
              The writer (of the stories) and I have decided it's best for us to let Neptune take the title of the elusive queen, while focusing more
              on more tangible features of Uranus and how to translate them into the sound paradigms (such as its howling winds, its pale, desert-like
              surface etc).

              Though Uranus's atmospheric pressure is not the thickest in the solar system, that one belongs to Venus. 
              The thickness of the planet's atmosphere varies greatly from 100 bar, to 10^-10 bar, as we go higher and 
              higher from the surface, where "surface" is any height which has the atmospheric pressure of 1 bar.

              Any object form in a protoplanetary disk would form in such a way that the direction of their rotation and the 
              axis on which they spin are almost identical. Uranus's tilt can be attributed, possibly, to a collision with an Earth-sized object, resulting
              in a radical tilt of 97.77 degrees. In comparison, Earth is only 23 degrees tilted and Jupiter only 3.

              Uranus's moons are surprisingly not named after the characters from Roman mythology, but rather, of Shakespearian origin. The biggest of which is named after 
              the queen of fairies from A Midsummer Night's Dream, Titania.

              Voyager 2's main mission was to study the 4 outer planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, with the eventual goal of 
              venturing on into the interstellar space beyond out solar system. It has left the heliospehere, a bubble of particles and magnetic field created
              by the sun, in November 2018. We are informed of its departure from the heliosphere through the information from the Plasma Science Experiment, 
              an instrument for measuring the level of plasma from the sun. As it leaves the bubble, we see a steep drop in the heliospheric particles and an

              Neptune, one of the most alluring planets of all. We have only ever visited the planet up close once, when Voyager 2 was 
              making a flyby of the gaseous planets in the 70s and 80s. Being the farthest planet away from the sun, at the time of writing,
              we have very little information about the planet. But what we do know is that it is very stormy, it's got the fastest wind speed
              in the solar system, of 2,200 km/h. It also has a cloud top with no solid surface, similar to the other 3 gaseous planets. We have
              also learnt a lot about the planet's composition from Earth, too. However, much remains a mystery. My composition is a tribute to
              her mystifying pulchritude.

              Due to the multitude of unsolved mysteries surrounding this planet, composing a piece for her was a unique challenge; how do I go about
               musically describing the planet with such <b>little</b> information? Looking at the available information we can deduce that 1, it is a windy planet,
              so a windy sound might be suitable; 2, it is very hard to spot, even harder than the faintest star in the sky (it was even discovered
              not through telescopic observations, but mathematical calculations), so using musical materials that are short, transient in nature, with, sparsely, 
              something that is long but not too present so as to not pull away from the mysterious sprinkles of sound those short sounds create. Combining these 
              with sprinkles of my musical interpretation and we have the piece you are listening to(hopefully) right now.

              The blue hue of the planet can be attributed to the methane in its atmosphere reflecting away blue wavelength. In comparison, the coloration
              of Uranus is different thanks to the greater volume of ices on Neptune's surface.

              Similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot, this Great Dark Spot on Neptune is roughly the same size as Earth, with initial dimensions of 13,000 x 6,600 km. White traces
              around the storm are crystals of frozen methane in the tropopause layer, as opposed to crystal ice in Earth's clouds. 
              <br>
              <br>
              The spot was thought to have disappeared or have been covered up in 1994, when the Hubble Space Telescope photographed Neptune. In 2016, however, another similar spot 
              has appeared in the northern hemisphere and remained visible for several years. Currently, the observations of the planet and it is difficult at this time to get 
              more information through telescopic observations alone.

              Despite having more than a dozen moons, Neptune's distance from the sun, and its wide orbit of 165 years, Neptune spends most of its
              time in isolation; far away from any planet. 
              
              Neptune's distance from Earth is about 4 billion kilometers, that is 1 billion more than from Earth to Uranus.

              Had things gone the other way round, this magnificent blue planet would have been called "Galle" or "Le Verrier" after its founders.
              But Neptune became the internationally accepted name due to the demand for a mythological name that was in keeping with the
              nomenclature of other planets'.
              <br>
              <br>
              Many cultures, however, have their own variant(s) of the planet's name. In Thailand, for example, it is either referred to as "Dao Neptune"
              or, less commonly, "Dao Khet", a name influenced by the Hindu astrology.

              Neptune, despite being closer than the millions of stars in our night sky, is invisible to the naked eye. The image below, from a YouTuber Skynine
              shows an edited image of Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune next to one another, captured through his home telescope. The farther a planet is from the sun, the less light it reflects back 
              into the empty space, hence the reduced visibility.

              Prior to the 20th century, prior to Voyager 2's brief visit to the Neptunian system, we had very little information about the planet.
              For example, we did not even know that the planet has 13 more moons other than Triton, which was discovered relatively with ease, only 
              17 days after the discovery of Neptune.

              Shown below is a photo taken by Voyager 2 57 million kilometers away from the planet. In comparison, we can get a much better view
              of Mars from Earth, despite her being farther 163 million kilometers away.
