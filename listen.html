              But I’m not the tiniest. Pluto is the tiniest amongst us Milky Way siblings. 
              But I heard Pluto was <span style="cursor: help" onmousedown="displaysonOver('mercury-info-kickedout')" ><strong>kicked out</strong></span> 
              of the family because he was too small and too far away. 
              Well, I think Pluto is <i>ohana</i> and <i>ohana</i> means family and family mean no one gets
               left behind or forgotten. But Planet 3627-7 inhabitants say otherwise. 
               Well, I have never crossed paths with Pluto, so I guess they must be right. It's still a pity though.
              <br>
              <br>
              I’m hot. But I’m not the hottest. 
              My next door <span style="cursor: help" onmousedown="displaysonOver('mercury-info-neighbors')"><strong>neighbors</strong></span> are hotter than me.  
              Venus, my sister, likes to keep the heat to herself. 
              Sun, my roommate, is literally a star. Sun and I usually go for walks in circles, 
              although I mostly do the walking and spinning while Sun just <span style="cursor: help" onmousedown="displaysonOver('mercury-info-stays')" ><strong>stays on her seat</strong></span>. 
              Everyone else walks at a slower pace, but I guess it’s because they’re not as close to Sun as I am. 
              Well, our friendship is kind of inclusive, so only a select few are within our orbit.
              <br>
              <br>
              Why is it that my other brothers and sisters get to have visitors that come through the door while only 
              I have <span style="cursor: help" onmousedown="displaysonOver('mercury-info-visitors')" ><strong>visitors</strong></span> that stay at a distance and just take pictures? 
              I thought MESSENGER would at least stay for tea, but he only took a few photos and then died on my doorstep, 
              leaving a 16 meter crack on my pretty surface. The audacity!
              <br><br>
              And sun, my roommate! Goodness, sometimes when she's mad, 
              she throws a tantrum and hits me with her waves <strong style="cursor: help" onmousedown="displaysonOver('mercury-info-solarwinds')">solar winds</strong>, 
              stripping away my atmosphere and stealing my breath away.
              <br>
              <br>
              Sometimes I cry about my appearance. I’m gray and wrinkly and <span style="cursor: help" onmousedown="displaysonOver('mercury-info-dead')" ><strong>dead</strong></span>. 
              There’s nothing interesting about me and I have no moons to speak of. 
              I might as well be a moon myself, as Planet 3627-7’s moon looks a lot like me.
               Venus says my wrinkles look like interweaving constellations. 
               I think she’s just trying to be nice, but it’s the thought that counts.

              Mercury is currently the smallest planet in the solar system.
              Its close proximity to the sun makes it more sensitive to any solar activity, so much so that we can study the effects of our aging sun through the planet. 
              It orbits around the sun blazingly fast, at the speed of around 87.97 Earth days, but on the contrary, it rotates so slow, only 3 times every 2 mercury years, 
              that astronomers once thought that it was tidally locked with the sun. But a slow rotation is nonetheless a slow rotation, and it has resulted in the planet having 
              wildly different temperatures at all times. The side facing the sun can get as hot as 427 degrees celsius, whereas the night side can get as low as -180 degrees. 
              The reason for this being the strong solar radiation constantly strips away Mercury's atmosphere. Without a sufficiently thick atmosphere, 
              the planet is unable to dissipate heat to the other side 
              of the planet and thus resulted in the majority of it being dissipated instead into space.

              For Mercury, I have decided to create a piece that is more in keeping with the scientific facts than being a mere artistic interpretation that loosely 
              connected here and there with the actual information. This composition reflects the strong solar radiation and the huge visible mass of the sun, through mediums such as constant low hum, a drone that is designed to not be aurally pleasing but to imitate the actual 
              Solar waves; the size of Mercury in the presence of the sun is represented by several high pitched noises surrounded by sporadic electromagnetic interferences 
              from the sun; and the stripping away of its atmosphere from a stream of the solar wind. 
              <br><br>
              Of course, the music is not 100% accurate as it is nonetheless a piece of music, 
              but I have attempted to be more accurate with each aural representation of these astronomical events.

              Mercury is not only small but is shrinking as well as the planet cools down. It is now 14 kilometers smaller in diameter than it was 4 billion years ago.
              Mercury is not the only planet losing its heat over billions of years, in fact, every celestial object is, from the sun to the farthest planet in our solar system,
               but Mercury seems to be the one affected the most, due to its core accounting for over 60% of its mass. In comparison, Earth's core is only 15% of its volume.
                <br>
               <br>
               This shrinking of Mercury over millions of years has given rise to ridges and escarpments alongside its marks from asteroid impacts.
               To the left is a alse color image taken by MESSENGER spacecraft. It reveals ridges, escarpments, and craters through 
               colors, with blue being low and yellow/green showing higher elevations.

              The reclassification was due to Pluto failing to meet the third criterion of the International Astronomical Union. The third criterion
              states that it must have cleared its neighboring region of other objects -- to put simply, there must not be any other objects
              sharing its orbit. It is now holding the status of a dwarf planet, along with several others such as Makemake, Ceres, Eris, Haumea, etc.
              Most of which resides beyond the orbit of Neptune, with some being in the Kuiper Belt.

              Had Mercury been allowed a thicker atmosphere, the planet's temperature would soar past that of venus and snatch the title of the hottest
              object in the solar system besides the sun. <br><br>Currently, it's already thin atmosphere is being stripped away from the strong solar wind of the sun.
              With a very weak magnetic field and it's unfortunate positioning, the planet has no possible way of mitigating the effect of the solar phenomenon.

              According to Newton's third law, every planet orbits its stars, or every satellite its planet, exert an equivalent amount of
              pull in its own direction; the smaller the mass, the smaller the pull. This tug of war causes both objects to orbit around a center of mass. 
              Between a small object such as Mercury and the sun, the effect is more difficult to detect, but it is there. In fact, this minuscule wobble in a star causes a doppler effect, and it is one of the methods scientists use
              to detect exoplanets thousands of light 
              -years away. <br><br>
              <img src="videos/DopplerEffect.gif" style="width: 300px; float: left">
              Doppler effect is a phenomenon whereby the frequency of a wave is changed in relation to an observer; namely, during the dance between 
              a star and its planet, as the star wobble closer to us (observer), the light wave gets squished, and as it moves farther, the wave gets 
              more spaced out. We can detect this wobble through the shift in the spectrum of light and a plethora of exoplanets have been discovered through
              this method. 
              <br><br>
              Doppler effect is how RADAR detects the speed of an object combining the shift in the received signal and the interval between the send and receive.
              This effect is also responsible for the shift in the sound of siren's and race cars as they move closer and away from an observer.

              So far, only two spacecraft have visited Mercury, the Mariner 10 in the seventies, and a much more recent visit from MESSENGER in 2008. 
              The current detailed photographic mapping and data that we have of Mercury was taken and collected by MESSENGER during its three flybys. 
              <br><br>
              The spacecraft became the first to have entered Mercury's orbit in 2011.
               Similar to Cassini's death, MESSENGER used its last propellant to deorbit itself and crash into the planet. 
               The last farewell photo from the spacecraft was a photo of a flat plain, a then crater after MESSENGER's crash.

              On the outside, Mercury might look just like our moon, dead and lifeless. But MESSENGER's mission has revealed the contrary. 
              Mercury is NOTHING like the moon, it might be much less active than it was when it was younger. We know that it has, weak though it is, a 
              magnetic field. And false color image has revealed that its mineralogy of the planet is also vastly different from our satellite. We can 
              leverage these findings to help us answer questions about how rocky planets such as Earth and Mercury evolve overtime.

              They live with plants and beasts that can kill them, but they have dominion above them all. 
              They breathe in gases that burn them slowly inside at the rate of about 80 cycles around the sun. 
              They have created settlements where temperatures dip to as low as -90 degrees and as high as 50 degrees and still reproduce. 
              They capture the wind in the sails of their contraptions and journey across the waters. 
              They then take the wind as their own and fly above the sky, defying their planet’s own gravity. 
              The sun’s solar winds hit its atmosphere but instead of fearing it, they stare in awe at the lights they have named

              Earth, our home. Our only home. Our entire history is written on the surface of this minuscule blue globe. She has been taking care of us for millions
              of years. Writing music for something that encapsulates so many things people can relate to is possibly one of the most challenging aspects of this 
              project. The way I approached this is to capture the essence of sounds we are familiar with through use of synthesizers and acoustic sounds sampling.
              For example, the sound of white noise could represent a number of things, waterfall, wind, the rustling of leaves, ocean waves, etc. Of course, pure white noise
              would not sound so good without proper manipulation, so, that will be part of the process as well. 
              <br>
              <br>
              
              The use of synthesizers in this piece is to bring the sense of being similar, yet not entirely so; an aural uncanny valley. Had I used
              entirely acoustic sounds, the elements of this piece would sound too familiar, people would recognize immediately where to place the 
              sounds in their perceived reality. What I intend for this piece is to bring the listener out of their reality and to look at Earth the same
              way we look at other planets; the marvel she holds and her fragility. The writer of the story for Earth has perfectly captured the essence of 
              my intention in her beautifully written work on the left.

	            During the formation of the solar system, we can see from the composition of the inner planets that water and other gaseous elements could not have possibly formed within this region, as it was far too hot
              for liquid water to form. The accepted theory now is that water was delivered to Earth from icy planetesimals from the farther region of the protoplanetary disk.

              Solar winds fly straight to Earth from the sun at the speed of roughly 400 km/s. Our planet's magnetic field deflects off the particles from the sun, with few collects

              During the protoplanetary disk stage, the four rocky inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, each acquired their own atmosphere by pulling in gas from the 
              disk when they grew large enough to resist the gas drag posed by the surrounding gas. To retain the gathered gas, each planet must be sufficiently large, such that
              the escape velocity is greater than the speed of the gas's atom. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Earth's atmosphere came from absorbing those gases during the early stage and the ones spewing out of volcanoes. Early Earth's atmosphere was similar to Venus, 
              as both planets formed in relatively close proximity of each other. The breathable air that we have today is thanks to the early life forms on earth that brought in 
              the photosynthetic system.

              Launched in 1977, Voyager 1 currently holds the place for the farthest human-made object from Earth. Traveling at the speed of 17km/s the spacecraft would take about 300 more years to
              reach the edge of our solar system: Oort cloud and will be in 1.7 light-years of its destination in the constellation Ophiuchus, the star AC+79 3888, in the year 40,272 AD.

              Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft both had small metal plates loaded onto them that carried the information of their place of origin. For Voyager 1, 
              however, the data was a tad more ambitious. The message is carried by a gold-plated copper disk phonograph record. It contains  music from various periods
              , sounds from many cultures, and images showing the diversity of life on Earth.

              humans slowly evacuate from the dying planet Earth. As they approach the looming red planet, several thoughts pop up in their heads, from
              the scarcity of resources to the vast and empty inhabitable landscape on which to become their new home, most likely until their last breath.

              In the night sky, Mars is the third brightest planet behind Jupiter and Venus. It appears as an orange-red-hued bright dot in the night sky close to Saturn, Jupiter, and the star Antares. With a good enough home telescope, we can 
              see very fine details on Mars, even its ice caps. <img src="pictures/Mars in the night sky.jpg" style="width: 300px; float: right">

              Observed by many civilizations throughout history, Babylonians, Chinese, Egyptians, Italians, Greek, etc., with the first telescopic observation by Galileo Galilei. Humans' interest in this planet has always been nothing but strong, and even
              more so when we have deduced from the centuries of information that Mars could potentially have harbored life in the past, and how similar it used to be to our own planet.

            <p class="planetsubdesctext subtexthide" id="mars-info-red">
              The reddish hue on Mars is a result of rusty dust suspended in the atmosphere; however, a closer inspection of the planet would reveal that the surface is more orange-red rather than the strong reddish hue depicted in many
              oversaturated photos on the internet.
              <img src="pictures/MarsSurface.jpg" style="width: 300px; float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
              <br>
              <br>
              The rust in the atmosphere comes from the oxidized iron on the surface. The iron oxide, which is the same compound that gives blood its red color, when 
              interacting with oxygen, appears red as it absorbs blue and green spectrum of light.
              We don't know, however, whether the rust on Mars occurred due to rainstorms in the past, when Mars was still a young and rather wet planet, 
              or is it a gradual process of the rocks' interaction to the Martian atmosphere over billions of years.

            <p class="planetsubdesctext subtexthide" id="mars-info-barren">
              One of the most concerning aspects of living on Mars lies in its nothingness. On Earth, most of our agricultural activities are done outdoors; grow crops, livestock, etc. But on Mars, its surface is a true rocky desert of nothingness, we will have to engineer our ways through the myriads of problems facing a true self-sustained colony; namely, how can we make sure that the colony will have a constant supply of Energy, how do we keep the few first generations of people sane, how do we grow food, how do we get water, etc. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Without air and most likely, a limited supply of oxygen at first, taking a walk outside would be out of the question. The temperature outside is a freezing minus 60 degrees with only 0.1% oxygen in the atmosphere. Mars dust is also recognized to be harmful to our respiratory systems. The biggest challenge of Mars therefore lies not only in how to get there but how to “stay” there.

            <p class="planetsubdesctext subtexthide" id="mars-info-storm"> 
              We have learned about Mars’ storm the hard way when the probe Mariner arrived at Mars in 1971 expecting to see new fine details of this planet’s surface. What we got instead was a storm that covers virtually the entire planet that lasted for a month. 
              <img src="pictures/MarsStorm.jpg" alt="" style="margin: 15px; width: 300px; float: right">
              <br>
              <br>
              The dust storm on Mars contains dust particles that are much finer than on Earth. 
              All equipment must be specially engineered to be functional for a sustained period in such a condition, such as NASA’s rovers. 
              Mars has a relatively thin atmosphere of 1% of Earth’s atmosphere, so storms of Mars would be comparable to a light breeze on Earth. 
              However, Mars is still a very “dusty” place, and this could pose several problems in the long run such as blocking the sunlight from the solar panels, 
              thus decreasing the power output significantly.

            <p class="planetsubdesctext subtexthide" id="mars-info-gravity">
              The gravity on Mars is about 3.711 meters per second squared, in other words, an object falling at Mars would see an increase in its speed by 3.711 m/s every second. 
              In comparison, Earth is about 9.807 m/s^2. A person weighing 100kg on Earth would only weigh around 38kg on Mars. 
              Though we might not be able to jump as high as portrayed in the film John Carter, a realistic height of 2.64 jump still sounds rather fun.

              With gravity even fewer than half of Earth’s, astronauts on Mars would have to work hard to prevent muscle atrophy. 
              Though it will definitely not be as bad as their spaceflight to the planet will have been, 
              living in such a condition for a long period of time could bring about several medical conditions.

              Saturn has a harlem of icy moons under her wing, with Enceladus being the most scientifically intriguing. 
              She is an icy moon with a liquid water ocean underneath its surface. Its thermal vents periodically spewing out water 
              ice out into space, which can then be collected by spacecraft. And from these sampled ingredients, we have found Enceladus 
              to be very promising for alien life to thrive, as it has all the necessary chemical ingredients.<br><br>
              
              
              Before we found out about its underwater geysers, researchers were dumbfounded as to how Enceladus got 
              its stripes all over the surface. The thermal activity under Enceladus can be attributed to the gravitational tidal 
              forces impose upon the moon as rotates around Saturn, stretching and squeezing it, resulting in heat. With heat comes pressure, 
              and with such an enormous pressure building up underneath, cracks get formed, and eventually, the thinnest part of the

              Titan is said to be able to "hypothetically" harbor some sort of non-water-based life. 
              Why? Titan is the only place besides Earth known to have systems of liquid lakes, seas 
              and rivers present on its surface. The difference is that those liquids are not water, 
              but rather methane and ethane. Titan is also large enough to be classified as a plant, 
              had it not been orbiting Saturn; it is even larger than Mercury.

              <br>
              <br>
              Because of its methane-rich nature, methane in its atmosphere gets broken down by ultraviolet 
              light to ethane and acetylene, giving it its blue-enveloped orange hue.

              Orbital resonance is a phenomenon that occurs whenever there are 2 or more celestial bodies orbiting a common object. 
              The ratios for a perfect orbital resonance are near-integer, whereas unstable resonances produce decimals. 
              Some near-integer ratios can be seen in this

              </span>

              Resonances will also affect the eccentricities of the involved objects, 
              such that the geometric relationship of their orbits are altered. 
              See the right image for a graphical representation of a Laplace Resonance; 
              an orbital resonance involving three bodies that have a ratio of 1:2:4.
              <br><br>
              A stable resonance is what keeps any orbiting body stable, namely, any external 
              gravitational influence will not be able to disrupt a system where an orbital resonance occurs.  
              In the case of Saturn, orbital resonances give rise to a stable trail of particles around the ring,
               whereas unstable gaps, such as the two occupied by two of Jupiter's moons.

              Equipped onboard Cassini were both wide and narrow-angle cameras. This image is arguably

              With Saturn blocking the sun's devastating ray, Cassini was able to point its camera directly towards both the planet and

              Cassini's death was arguably the most dramatic and well-known spacecraft suicide, if you can call it that, of all time. Possibly 
              because the last mission happened between 2016 and 2017; during the renaissance of the social network. Her last "Grand Finale" was a series of
              daring maneuvers, with the final goal of plunging into Saturn's atmosphere, ending it's long 20 years adventure.
              <br><br>
              <img src="pictures/daphnisInRing.jpg" style="width: 300px; float: right; margin-left: 11px;" alt="">
              Cassini's last series maneuvers expanded over six-month in length. It was daring and dangerous, but it was at the end of her mission
              and scientists understood the risk. And it was indeed worth every risk. The spacecraft had to dive through the gap between Saturn's rings
              every week, giving us invaluable data and images such as the one to the right.
              
              <br><br>
              <img src="videos/rotatingTitan.gif" style="width: 300px; float: left; margin-right: 11px;" alt="">
              The picture shows Daphnis, one of Saturn's smaller satellites, orbiting Saturn in between two of her rings. These six months, however, should
              not be the only thing Cassini is known for, as her 20-year-journey has given us much more than that. To the left is a .gif showing Cassini's mapping
              of Saturn's biggest moon, Titan. Cassini dropped the piggybacking <i>Huygens</i> Lander onto the moon. Together, they both have given us 
              enough data to confirm that Titan, alongside Enceladus, could be harbouring life some form, if not on the surface, then under. <br><br>
              
              The data, was actually why they needed to crash
              Cassini into Saturn, as we need to keep the moons clean for future exploration and to prevent any stowaway microbial life from spreading
              colonies on them.
              <br><br>
              During her final plunge, she managed to collect some outstanding data  regarding those, but not limited to, Saturn's rotation speed and its magnetic field. The highlight of
              the show, however, was its last picture, a picture that would most certainly leave an indelible footprint in the history of space travels. 
              The picture itself reveals nothing of stellar nature, but it is rich with stories. It speaks of the incredible things humans can do; it is the 
              culmination of sweat and tears of 28 nations; it is an escarpment of goodness amongst the tundra of chaos and conflicts in the world. It reminds the pointlessness
              of wars and battles. Without an eye on the horizon, it asks us is it even living -- fighting for something so perennial?

              Mysteries shroud this cerulean planet. Uranus, alongside Neptune, are two planets that are relatively lacking
              in details. The other 2 giants, Jupiter and Saturn has had spacecraft sent specifically to study them in details;
              Juno for Jupiter, and Cassini-Huygens for Saturn. This has made the process of composing a piece for Uranus and Neptune 
              more challenging as our information is rather limited and both planets, as far as we know, share quite a number of similarities,
              even the color. I therefore have decided to focus on different aspects of their features. I can either on their elusiveness and
              the artistic portrayal, or something that describes them in a more intimate way, such as the planets' features, and how
              to translate them into sonic paradigms.
              <br><br>
              The writer (of the stories) and I have decided it's best for us to let Neptune take the title of the elusive queen, while focusing more
              on more tangible features of Uranus and how to translate them into the sound paradigms (such as its howling winds, its pale, desert-like
              surface etc).

              Though Uranus's atmospheric pressure is not the thickest in the solar system, that one belongs to Venus. 
              The thickness of the planet's atmosphere varies greatly from 100 bar, to 10^-10 bar, as we go higher and 
              higher from the surface, where "surface" is any height which has the atmospheric pressure of 1 bar.

              Any object form in a protoplanetary disk would form in such a way that the direction of their rotation and the 
              axis on which they spin are almost identical. Uranus's tilt can be attributed, possibly, to a collision with an Earth-sized object, resulting
              in a radical tilt of 97.77 degrees. In comparison, Earth is only 23 degrees tilted and Jupiter only 3.

              Uranus's moons are surprisingly not named after the characters from Roman mythology, but rather, of Shakespearian origin. The biggest of which is named after

              Voyager 2's main mission was to study the 4 outer planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, with the eventual goal of 
              venturing on into the interstellar space beyond out solar system. It has left the heliospehere, a bubble of particles and magnetic field created
              by the sun, in November 2018. We are informed of its departure from the heliosphere through the information from the Plasma Science Experiment,

              The days on all giants of the Solar System are significantly shorter than on Earth. A day on Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Uranus are 
              about 9, 10, 16, and 17 hours respectively. This fast rate of spin can be largely attributed to their greater angular momentum during 
              their formation phase from gathered gasses.

              Neptune, one of the most alluring planets of all. We have only ever visited the planet up close once, when Voyager 2 was 
              making a flyby of the gaseous planets in the 70s and 80s. Being the farthest planet away from the sun, at the time of writing,
              we have very little information about the planet. But what we do know is that it is very stormy, it's got the fastest wind speed
              in the solar system, of 2,200 km/h. It also has a cloud top with no solid surface, similar to the other 3 gaseous planets. We have
              also learnt a lot about the planet's composition from Earth, too. However, much remains a mystery. My composition is a tribute to
              her mystifying pulchritude.

              Due to the multitude of unsolved mysteries surrounding this planet, composing a piece for her was a unique challenge; how do I go about
               musically describing the planet with such <b>little</b> information? Looking at the available information we can deduce that 1, it is a windy planet,
              so a windy sound might be suitable; 2, it is very hard to spot, even harder than the faintest star in the sky (it was even discovered
              not through telescopic observations, but mathematical calculations), so using musical materials that are short, transient in nature, with, sparsely, 
              something that is long but not too present so as to not pull away from the mysterious sprinkles of sound those short sounds create. Combining these 
              with sprinkles of my musical interpretation and we have the piece you are listening to(hopefully) right now.

              The blue hue of the planet can be attributed to the methane in its atmosphere reflecting away blue wavelength. In comparison, the coloration
              of Uranus is different thanks to the greater volume of ices on Neptune's surface.

              Similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot, this Great Dark Spot on Neptune is roughly the same size as Earth, with initial dimensions of 13,000 x 6,600 km. White traces
              around the storm are crystals of frozen methane in the tropopause layer, as opposed to crystal ice in Earth's clouds. 
              <br>
              <br>
              The spot was thought to have disappeared or have been covered up in 1994, when the Hubble Space Telescope photographed Neptune. In 2016, however, another similar spot 
              has appeared in the northern hemisphere and remained visible for several years. Currently, the observations of the planet and it is difficult at this time to get 
              more information through telescopic observations alone.

              Despite having more than a dozen moons, Neptune's distance from the sun, and its wide orbit of 165 years, Neptune spends most of its

              Neptune's distance from Earth is about 4 billion kilometers, that is 1 billion more than from Earth to Uranus.

              Had things gone the other way round, this magnificent blue planet would have been called "Galle" or "Le Verrier" after its founders.
              But Neptune became the internationally accepted name due to the demand for a mythological name that was in keeping with the
              nomenclature of other planets'.
              <br>
              <br>
              Many cultures, however, have their own variant(s) of the planet's name. In Thailand, for example, it is either referred to as "Dao Neptune"
              or, less commonly, "Dao Khet", a name influenced by the Hindu astrology.

              Neptune, despite being closer than the millions of stars in our night sky, is invisible to the naked eye. The image below, from a YouTuber Skynine
              shows an edited image of Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune next to one another, captured through his home telescope. The farther a planet is from the sun, the less light it reflects back 
              into the empty space, hence the reduced visibility.

              Prior to the 20th century, prior to Voyager 2's brief visit to the Neptunian system, we had very little information about the planet.
              For example, we did not even know that the planet has 13 more moons other than Triton, which was discovered relatively with ease, only 
              17 days after the discovery of Neptune.
