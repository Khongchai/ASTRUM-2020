            <br>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Throughout the history of mankind, humans have 
                always been ever so fascinated by nature and the mysteries hidden within. 
                In our attempt to decipher the clues and understand our place in the universe, we asked: 
                “why are we here?”, “what is the purpose of our lives?”.
            </div>
            
            <div class="paragraph">
                We looked up at the sky and wondered what was out there. 
                The sky, it was the unreachable, the beyond, so we thought “maybe that is where our answers lie”? From the very beginning of 
                human civilization, each culture in their own way, both existing and lost, have formulated their own unique, sometimes similar 
                ideas and theories about the objects in the sky and our relationship to them. The notion of us being simply a confluence of accidents 
                was unrealistic. “Things are too perfect” we say. For chemistry to transform into biology, everything has to be just right. Our world 
                is situated in a zone not too cold and not too hot; our sun not too old nor too young; our world, lots of water with ample land mass for
                life to propagate; most of the Earth-ending sized asteroids are deviated away thanks to our giant neighbor Jupiter; and the magnetic field 
                of Earth protects us from the sun’s deathly rays, allowing us to formulate ideas how all these came together. 
            </div>

            <div class="paragraph">
                So, there must be a creator(s)? This manifestation of life is several accidents happening on top of one another. 
                This symphony of life is too harmonious for it to have formed on its own. Someone or something must have orchestrated everything.
                 But where, then, are the creator(s)? Well, we know from the plethora of geological evidence on this subject that many cultures and 
                 religions in the past have  unspoken-ly agreed that heavens should be up in the sky and hell below, while also at the same time also 
                 attributing the celestial bodies to certain deities along the way.  Despite being thousands of kilometers apart, in their own attempts
                  to make sense of it all, we see shared relationships between each culture and the sky; such as the Chinese Feng Shui, the Egyptian, 
                  Greek and Roman mythology, the Mayan gods, and several other polytheist cultures that associated belief system with the sky, or 
                  objects within it.  The moon, said to be a god, a timekeeper, a personification of Rr romanticism, seems to embody various properties 
                  associated with the divine and the; virtuous. The sun, depicted in many cultures as having a face in the middle, usually plays the role 
                  of some type of solar deity, an omnipotent being, the head of all gods, that breathes life unto the Earth. These ideas, though mystical 
                  at first, would later slowly evolve through evidence, experiments, and studies into the field of science. And many prominent figures 
                  such as Darwin, Newton, Galilei, Copernicus, Clausius and Thompson, and many more, would rise to make some of the most impactful 
                  contributions ever done to the field of science.
            </div>

            <div class="paragraph">
                Music and science most likely began at the same point, the very dawn 
                of human civilization; the very moment we started to develop our unique form of complex communication,
                 language.  Music keeps a culture alive and science pushes it forward. It is not so surprising then,  
                 that the Greeks, music, and astronomy in particular were intrinsically interconnected. For the Greeks,
                  human creativity was attributed to goddesses known as ‘the Muses’; passing on their 9 attributes to humankind. 
                  Amongst these 9 we find music and astronomy (to which mathematics were very much related). Seeing the scientific 
                  field such as the study of the stars being categorized into the same group as music might seem bizarre to us today, but for them, 
                   these foundations formed the keys to understanding the harmony of the universe:

            <div class="paragraph">
                Musica Universalis is the idea that the proportions in the movements of celestial bodies such as the
                 planets and the sun are music, not music in the aural sense, but conceptually and mathematically. 
                Each of the hums emits by a body is thought to have an impact on the quality of life on Earth. Though 
                the idea is quite far-fetched, we now know of something somewhat similar.  Scientists, since the 17th 
                century has slowly developed over time the idea of planets’ orbits being locked in an orbital resonance; 
                namely, that when the orbits of planets or any object, be it belts of asteroids or clouds of dust,  
                are locked in a stable ratio close to being pure integers such as 2:1, 3:2, 4:3, etc. , 
                their orbits are locked in a way such that no external gravitational influence may alter
                 their orbit. The ratio exists sonically in terms of overtones of a pitch that are all an 
                 equivalent constant k hertz, based on the fundamental pitch, apart.  However, a linear 
                 increase in the ratio is not the only type of orbit. For example, the Laplace resonance 
                 describes an integer relationship of 4:2:1 between 3 orbiting bodies. This relationship 
                 exists in the orbits of Jupiter’s first three Galilean moons Io, Europa, and Ganymede. 
                 This relationship has no harmonic equivalence.

            <div class="paragraph">
                In the classical music world, abstract musical references to astronomical objects abound, 
                from Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata to Debussy’s Claire de Lune, Dvorak’s O Silvery Moon to Holst’s Planets. 
                 With the exception of a few arias, most of those musical interpretations came in the form of instrumental music, 
                 which by its wordless nature, requires the listeners to find ways to shape their thinking into connecting aural 
                 textures to the imagination of those distant systems. As such, any type of programmatic music   humbly reminds us of 
                 the ingenuity of people who must work around the limitation of instruments to craft the appropriate texture. We shall
                  look at some of that music, how they achieved it, and how those musical expressions related to their understanding of
                   the universe in their own respective time.

            <div class="topicMain"> 1. The Bringer of War.....or not?</div>
            <br>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Out of the many examples, one of the most 
                famous meetings of astronomy and /classical music 
                fusions can be found in Holst’s. ‘The Planets’.  This well-respected musical suite is often mentioned in 
                conversations about music and space. But as is often the case with space inspired music, this piece is not focused on
                scientific accuracy. When Holst was writing the suite, he drew his inspiration from astrology rather than astronomy, 
                this becomes clear to anyone looking closely at the titles of each movement. The title   of each planet is followed by
                the name the Roman gods and goddesses associated with it. As such, Holst’s interpretations are derived from the literal 
                or philosophical connotations conjured by the planet’s historical and cultural heritage, using a rather subjective personal
                artistic approach. Many composers in the past had the propensity to follow along this line, relying on intuitive expression 
                rather than accurate translations.   
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                The first movement from The Planet Suite: Mars, along with Jupiter, is without doubt the most well-known movement 
                out of all seven. Its ominous opening insinuates the onset of war, befitting the title “The Bringer of War”.
                As we know now, Mars is a desolate planet; nothing exists there but red rocks. And the red rocks are not a result
                of blood bathed rocks, but rather of something more familiar, rust, iron oxide. Formed a long time ago when water 
                and oxygen existed on Mars, the abundance of iron reacted to oxygen to create thin layers of iron-oxide which would
                later get spread around by the dust storm. Holst, understandably, had chosen to ignore this fact. as the public was
                well-aware of the reasons behind Mars’ redness.  By the time Holst finished the suite in 1918, a huge amount of studies
                had already been conducted on the subject of Mars and the public was also all over the Martian news as well. In 1870, 
                the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli mapped channels on Mars and published a paper, but the word channels in 
                Italian was mistranslated into canals, which indeed took the public by storm. In 1907, for example, an article in the
                LA Times mentioned how scientists have declared that the dark spots on Mars – the channels, were canals constructed 
                by Martians as a part of their irrigation system. And again in 1911, by an article in the New York Times, the headline goes: 
                <br><br>
                <span class="quoteblock">
                    <span>

            <div class="paragraph">
                Those ill-informed news articles show us that Holst must have, in 
                some way, been aware of the scientific facts, but like many classical
                 music composers before and after him, chose to not follow the science but their heart.

            <div class="paragraph">
                
                The Moon is another fortunate celestial victim (in-a-good-way) of inaccurate representations. We have Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, 
                Debussy’s Claire de Lune, Dvorak’s O Silvery Moon, and Haydn’s ‘The World on the Moon’, amongst many others. Those pieces are often more
                 evocative of the atmosphere encountered at a dinner party by a silvery moonlight-casted lake than the barren pockmarked surface of the moon. 
                 There is no way anyone would actually compose such enchanting music when they look at the real face of the moon, full of holes, lifeless and gray.
                  As great as these pieces are, in no way do they present anything new in terms of textures techniques or realistic musical interpretations. 
                  The sonic limitations imposed by the tonal system prevent them from evocating celestial dimensions with any accuracy.

            <div class="paragraph">
                The poetic and subjective musical interpretations of astronomy would later see itself paralleled by a new, fast-rising musical trend, 
                one that attempts to be more in keeping with the scientific findings; deriving and transposing them as accurately as possible into musical parameters.

                As the world becomes more connected, be it through advancement in the field of communication or transportation, 
                information and inventions find themselves spreading with ease, replicating themselves from person to person like genes.
                 This memeic behavior happens everywhere, including the field of music. New ideas constantly undulated through people, societies, 
                 and countries. As the bubble of a particular meme grows larger, more people become aware and more -related contributions are made.
                  In the following sections, we shall look at how this idea of accurate musical interpretation found itself slowly metastasized to 
                  some parts of the music community.

                 and cost. With only cables, people also had to pay for what they do not watch, and if they do not film the broadcast themselves, 
                 their options of watching the broadcasted video would be rather limited. Streaming, however good it is, would not have been possible,
                  had it not for the advent of the first prototypes of their respective technologies.

                On April 9, 1860, Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville created the first sound recording. 
                The device he used was called “phonautograph”, the earliest known device capable of preserving sound. 
                The voice in the recording appears to be distorted. This might have been due to the translation into a 
                modern audio file format or the inaccuracies of the recording device itself, or both. But however inaccurate 
                this device was, this milestone set by Scott is tantamount in importance for the field of audio technology,

                 many types of audio-visual technologies. Sound design had, of course, already existed long before
                  the time of motion pictures, but purely in the form of instrumental sound design. Due to their engaging 
                  and diverse content, their  length, and their popularity, proved to be an excellent playground for sound 
                  engineers, musicians, and composers to test out their ideas, both analogue -- now with more than ever flexibility 
                  thanks recording device -- and digital -- which benefited greatly from the  rather paralleled evolution of audio technology 
                  alongside motion pictures.

                After WWII, in response to the demand of the returning public markets all over the world, existing military
                 technology was gradually  adapted for the general consumer, those new innovations in broadcast industries and
                  consumer electronics  created a new generation of audiophiles. The ever-decreasing price, weight and the ever-increasing 
                  quality of audio were more than enticing to people of all ages, especially the youngsters. And it was these young people
                   who grew up to become innovators.  Musicians, composers, and engineers exchanged their informed vision, helping push the 
                   Eboundaries of the art of music creation by providing many new possibilities for sonic and visual expression.

            <div class="paragraph">
                Before we dive in, it is important we explore what is outside the film world first, as music 
                innovation did not come solely through working with films, outside of the film world, there exists 
                another type of world that try to push the boundary of music as well, if not more than those working in the films. 
                Many of the techniques used today such as granular synthesis, originated from a scientific paper about quantum mechanics. 
                The paper was presented by the Hungarian-British physicist Dennis Gabor in 1947. His proposition was to combine the frequency-domain 
                and time-domain information together to create a new way of representing sounds. The fundamental idea of his theory was that the ear has 
                a threshold for recognizing sound properties, below this threshold all the sounds, regardless of their timbre or pitch, will be heard as 
                clicks. He called this idea the “acoustic quanta”, a reference to the actual quantum, which is the science that deals with really small 
                things. By applying Fourier analysis to each of these small chunks, 
                we facilitate the development of musical models using the mathematical tools akin to those actually used in quantum physics.

            <div class="paragraph">
                The celebrated composer Iannis Xenakis provides further innovative examples of music 
                derived from mathematical concepts. He was also the first composer to turn the granular model
                 into a real-life application. The first acoustic piece he applied this technique to was called
                  Analogique A-B for String Orchestra and Tape. Presently, we use mathematics and algorithms to help
                   us achieve the effects of granular synth instantaneously; with a turn of a knob in our DAW of choice. 
                   Back then, Xenakis had to devise his own method using an analog tone 
                generator and tape splicer. Comparatively, his method takes significantly longer to achieve what we can do in a second. 
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                In his book Formalized Music, which he published in 1971, he laid out the principles for his
                 mathematical-based composition method. A method which he had used to write his piece Pithoprakta.
                  His model described the erratic movement of the electrons on atoms sonically.
                 This type of mathematical representation has opened the doors for developing stochastic music models of quantum mechanics.

                4.1 Atonal Music
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                After World War 2, people, especially in Europe were tired, worn from all the violence of the war.
                 After losing so many of their friends and families, people shunned away from lively,
                 happy music and turned to something more objective: Atonal Music. 
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                WW2 was of course not the only reason people turned to Atonal, part of that
                was the will to explore a new aural frontier through experimentation with new
                technologies. People spearheading this expedition were those such as Schonberg, 
                Stockhausen, Xenakis, and Webern, among many others. As important as Schonberg’s 
                contributions to this field, Stockhausen relates more to our topic, as he has done various experiments
                with electronic music and some of the topics of his compositions deal directly with the subject of astronomy.

            <div class="paragraph">
                Karlheinz Stockhausen was a German composer, from the planet Sirius, if he is to be believed.
                He is acknowledged as being one of the most influential, important, and controversial composers. 
                His compositions and theories remain important and are being constantly studied today. His works 
                span over various genres and subgenres. His electronic music subgenres are those such as  acousmatic
                music, music concrete, etc. His approach is vastly different from all his contemporaries. Composers 
                such as Anton Webern and Arnold Schoenberg had confined the principle of serialism to pitch whereas 
                Stockhausen, beginning with his composition Kreuzspiel, in 1951, extended the principle instead only 
                to pitches, but to other musical elements: instrumentation, pitch, register, 
                intensity, melodic form, and time duration. The result is his music assuming a certain level of geometric organization.

                During the time of 2001’s Space Odyssey debut in 1968, the tropes of the sci-fi film of that era were full of 
                monsters and teenage problems, with the arrival of this film, its challenging narrative, intriguing audiovisual
                 tactics, and crazy-bold sound design and music, it redefined and set out new purposes for sci-fi films. 
                  It had totally shifted the mindset of the audience, their expectation and awareness were changed forever,
                   and with those changes in the public, the industry as a whole would have to adapt, 
                and sound became more than just an augmentation for the motion picture, it became a part of it, part of the narrative.

                This movie’s soundtrack has broken all the rules and tropes for Hollywood cinema.
                 Its soundtrack was eerie, texture like, music was used as a tool to push the story 
                 forward while still maintaining its role as a background and not getting in the way of the main narrative on the screen.

                5. The Arrival of Synthesizers
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                The history of synthesizers spans back several decades. This technology was the key to the hidden 
                world of sounds. The synthetic, attractively unnatural sound of the synth, though its origin is not 
                related to movies in any way, found its way into 
                the cinema and has ever since, been a crucial component in creating a convincing cinematic world.  
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Before synthesizers, there existed some types of musical instruments that require electricity, 
                with the most famous being the theremin. The synthesizer as we know it originated in the 1960s 
                when Robert Moog debuted his Moog synthesizer. And it was in the 1980s when the MIDI was introduced 
                and the synth market exploded, the sound of synthesizers could be heard anywhere, including and especially, 
                in sci-fi films. There were some movies that stuck to the old trend of orchestral music, such as Spielberg’s
                 film, usually composed by John Williams, Back to the Future, Psycho, The Exorcist, the GodFather, etc.  
                
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Films that embraced this technology has opened door to the new sonic frontier, to give an example,
                 the famous opening synth note from Yamaha CS-80 in Blade Runner that gave it such an iconic color to 
                 the movie; The famous Terminator theme played by Oberheim OB-Xa, SCI Prophet-10, Linndrum, and DMX and of 
                 the horror classic’s theme The Thing, amongst many others. What these films did was that they opened to new 
                 ideas and explored how they could utilize these new technologies to help them tell a story in a convincing and
                  refreshing manner. And I believe, they did just that, they all were the pioneer movies in their own regard, the
                   storytelling was already great, and they became even more memorable by their distinctive synth signature. As time 
                   goes by and as technology progresses, more and more directors become more aware of the potential these technologies 
                   have and how effective they can be when done right. Today, we have composers such as Hans Zimmer, Junkie XL, Thomas 
                   Newman, Harry Gregson-Williams, and many others in the industries who have embraced in one way or the other, the new 
                   opportunities available to them.

                6. The Portrayal of Science in Film Music
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Now let’s step back and look at all the musical references to any scientific ideas, phenomena, objects,
                 whatsoever in Film Music, both acoustic and electronic, and see how they are in comparison to the older 
                 generations such as the aforementioned Holst, Debussy, Beethoven, etc. 
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Composers of newer generations are undoubtedly better equipped when it comes 
                to flexibility and versatility. By being able to study every single great composer of the 
                past and with the help of new technologies, we have come up with many new ways of designing the sonic atmosphere for 
                certain things, in our case, space. And it did really change a lot, if we take a look at Haydn The World on the Moon overture,
                 it just sounds like any other classical music pieces from that era, whereas works by our contemporaries, such as the Cassini 
                 Goodbye series, commissioned by NASA to 3 electronic music composers Joseph Trapanese, Sarah Schachner and Ryan O’Neal as a tribute 
                 to the Cassini Spacecraft for its eventual descent into the abyss in Saturn atmosphere, we see completely different interpretations, 
                 be it in terms of harmony, instrumentation or structures and, most definitely more reverb on the modern side.     
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                When we look at the modern interpretation of music about space, we see, 
                sometimes an oversaturated use of effects such as reverb and delay, which of course are understandable 
                as they give the feeling of space, the spacious feeling which is befitting to the connotation the word itself 
                carries, but if we talk about an absolute depiction, something that makes us feel desolate like the actual space,
                 we may be able to look at NASA’s recordings of the electromagnetic activity, radiation all the things happen in space 
                 which had since the released date of the series, inspired many composers to implement them as a material for their compositions.
                  My task then would be to find out whether I can also implement certain principles mentioned here to portray parts of the universe
                   through creating a piece of music or not, be it artistic or absolute.
